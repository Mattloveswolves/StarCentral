               <p>Name: Matthew Maurice Williams Jr.
                Date of Birth: August 14th, 2000 
                Age: 18
                Sex / Gender : Male 
                Race : (Mixed) African American
                </p> 
                <p> My name is Matthew, I'm currently an 18 year old boy in highschool. 
                    I'll be graduating William Penn soon! 
                    I'm a semi active guy when it comes to technological areas and artistic areas! 
                    I do a lot of drawing in my freetime both digital and traditional, though I mostly draw my own characters! 
                    I also play a lot of games when I can and aim to one day become a game developer!
                    I love entertaining people and creating stuff that makes others happy. 
                    That's why I hope I can improve in many areas and someday make my own games!
                </p>
                <p>As for art specifically, I've only been drawing for 4 years. 
                    Though I've been surrounded by artists, musicians, movie makers, and more my entire life.
                    My uncle who actually both draws and writes music inspired me to get into game design and start drawing! 
                    Though what really got me started was when I joined a community just like me who loved fluffy animals, wolves, and stuff like zootopia!
                    At that point I feel in love with art and began drawing for myself and have improved tons!
                    I love art! 
                    It allows me to express things I'd normally not be able to! Just turning some music on and doodling I can easily deal with my moods. 
                    I'm hoping to one day share my happiness through art in general!

                <p>Name: Zachary Luis Gonzalez 
                    Date of Birth: November 3rd 2001 
                    Age: 17 
                    Sex / Gender : Male 
                     Race : (Mixed) African American
                </p>
                <p>Art (digital and traditional) is my main strength / talent, because since I have a high visual perception, I can design anyone or anything very detailed to make my artwork look realistic. Throughout my years as "Artist", I first started to do traditional arts (like drawing in sketchbooks and painting in canvases) at the age of 5 up now. Then, when I graduated to "William Penn High School" I wanted to learn how to create art designs, logos, and posters but on technology. In 9th grade I took "Graphic Design" class; after that I attended "Digital Media" class for 10th grade, and I'm still continuing to improve better in Junior year (11th grade), so learn how to make better music videos, do better on photoshop / illustrator, and to learn more about coding.  
                </p>
           
                 <p>My name is "Zachary Luis Gonzalez", and I'm a student of "William Penn High School". 
                I am a hard working teenager, when it comes to my school work;
                I like to challenge myself and put effort into whatever work I get, to get the job done and earn grades. 
                However, I also want to complete my goals /objectives at my high school, before I make my way to college. 
                I want to try to earn as many honor rolls as I can for my GPA; and as a "Artist" desires better improvements for my skills in "digital" and "traditional" arts, if I ever want to become game designer as a future job.
